# House-Price-Prediction
Code for a kaggle competition on advanced regression techniques for predicting house prices using the available data from the past.
The code is based on Python language and is written in a jupyter notebook.Some libraries will be required before running on your system for the code given such as pandas,numpy etc.

Got featured in top 5% of the total competitors <br>
Performed extensive exploratory data analysis to find all the intrinsic patterns present in the data<br>
Explored and engineered 80 features using various statistical methods to analyze their effect on house price<br>
Implemented various models to predict the house prices such as Gradient boosting, Random forest, XGboost and LightGbm<br>
Created an ensemble model by stacking all the models and then blending all of the models to get the final prediction<br>
